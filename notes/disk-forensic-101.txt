Disk Forensic 101
------------------

People generally believe that a file, once deleted, is gone from the hard disk and can no longer be retrived. This is not completely true. Deleting files only removes it from the disk content table. In a FAT system it is called File Allocation Table, in NTFS it is called Master File Table. Data is stored in clusters on the hard disk and consists of a certain number of bits. Parts of file are mostly scattered through the disc, and deleting the file makes it difficult to reconstruct them but not impossible. 

Extracting data from unallocated space is called file carving. It is a helpful technique in digital forensics that finds deleted or hidden files from media. A hidden file can lie in any area such as slack space, unallocated clusters, or lost culsters. In order to use file carving you need to locate the header and footer of the file. As these are generally created using a fixed, pre-defined format, it is normally easy to search for this on a hard disk. Once header and footer is found, we extract their location in hard disk and use that as our benchmark to see what part to perform more through search on. It is normally customary to extract all data located from the address of header ( lets say 1) to address of the footer ( lets say 20,000). All data between our example sector of 1 and 20,000 are extracted. Not all of these are going to be about our file but that's just the first net we cast to try and extract this data.
